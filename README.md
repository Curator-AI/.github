## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Curator.AI addresses the common challenges people face when furnishing their spaces. Many struggle with finding the right furniture due to limited time, overwhelming options, or difficulty in creating a cohesive and budget-friendly look. This often leads to indecision, misguided purchases, or no purchase at all. Curator.AI addresses these pain points by providing smart suggestions through context-aware AI recommendations, reducing users' browsing time with cohesive product options, enabling easy discovery of new items through conversational AI filtering and adjustable curation settings, and spatially visualizing products using AR technology.

We built a platform that leverages AI and AR technologies to provide personalized, context-aware furniture recommendations by integrating speech recognition, 3D object recognition, large vision-language models, and database retrieval. With a $254B US furniture market, Curator.AI aims to capture a significant share. Our business model includes two revenue streams: an 8% commission on customer transactions and earnings from vendors by offering targeted advertising plans. Our team spans across five departments at MIT. We bring together diverse, complementary experiences in Big Tech, AI, AR entrepreneurship, and research, offering valuable insights for industry leaders in e-commerce, such as Amazon, and computer-aided design, such as Autodesk. Our team members also have expertise in AI, machine learning, and architectural design.
